                    <h3 class="nocaps">1- Overview</h3>
                    <p class="last">This Agreement contains the complete terms and conditions that apply to you in joining, buying, and all other activities you will make on our website. By using site, you agree to be bound by its terms of use and shall comply thereof. This Agreement describes and encompasses the entire agreement between Just-FastFood (hereby referred to as 'us' or 'the company' or 'Just-FastFood') and you (hereby referred to as 'you', 'yourself' or 'the customer'), and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements, representations, warranties and understandings with respect to Just-FastFood.com, the content and computer programs provided by or through Just-FastFood.com, and the subject matter of this Agreement. Amendments to this agreement can be made and effected by us from time to time without specific notice to you.</p>
                    <h3 class="nocaps">2- Fastfood</h3>
                    <p class="last">Outlets such as McDonalds, KFC, Burger King, Nandos and Subway</p>
                    <h3 class="nocaps">3- Restaurants</h3>
                    <p class="last">Takeaway outlets such as Indian, Thai, Chinese, Kebab restaurants to mention but a few.</p>
                    <h3 class="nocaps">4-  Orders, Order Processing and Deliveries </h3>
                    <p class="last"> First-time customers will be required to register (online). All customer details will be stored electronically to help process future orders efficiently and quickly. We are bound by the Data Protection act and no information will be passed on or sold to a third party.

                        The minimum order amount is &pound;10.00 on food and/or soft drinks, etc (not including a delivery charge)

                        We always aim to dispatch and deliver orders as soon as humanly possible. Please allow 45 - 60 minutes for normal delivery times. At peak times (or where large orders that require longer preparation), during extraordinarily busy periods, and orders that require more than one stop by the delivery driver may take longer. Please understand that delays and or longer delivery times resulting from the scenarios described are out of our hands, and we always aim to get your order delivered as soon as humanly possible.
                        <br/>
                        During busy periods, some restaurants may choose not to accept orders for deliveries. If this is the case, we will notify you of this using the telephone numbers provided at the time of ordering, as soon as we are told / informed by the restaurant, and we will make every effort to find an alternative / similar member restaurant and will give you the choice to switch your order to that restaurant. Advance orders however may be taken for delivery during kitchen hours. Orders placed at busy restaurant periods will take longer to prepare which will/may affect delivery times.
                        By placing an order with us, you understand and acknowledge that food delivered, beverages and other items obtained from third parties for and on behalf of the customer, and that WE PROVIDE INDEPENDENT DELIVERY SERVICES AND NOT AFFILIATED WITH MCDONALDS, KFC, BURGER KING, SUBWAY OR NANDOS.
                    <br/>


                    Due to health and safety reasons, we do NOT permit our drivers to open/check packaging to confirm items r content and therefore cannot accept responsibility for incorrect items. However, if you do not receive the correct items, you must speak to us in the first instance and we will try our possible best to resolve any issue.



                        All complaints regarding quality of food should be directed to us in the first instance. We a are an independent delivery service and therefore the fastfood outlets (McDonalds, KFC, Burger King, Subway or Nandos) have no control over or liability for food products once they are removed from their premises by us.
                        Should it be necessary to contact the fastfood outlet, we will do so on behalf of the customer. We do not, however, offer compensation or replacements in such events.
                        <br/>
                        After placing an order with us, you will receive an e-mail from us acknowledging that we have received your order. This does not mean that your order has been accepted by us, but it does constitute an offer for us to deliver the items you have ordered. All orders are subject to acceptance by us, and we will confirm such acceptance when we pass the order to the restaurant or the third-party whose products you have ordered. In the event we decide not to accept your order, we will contact you using the telephone numbers you provided when placing the order, or registering your details when placing your first order. The contract between us will only be formed when we place the order with the restaurant in question or the third-party referred to above.
                        <br/>
                        Please check your order thoroughly before accepting it, as it is difficult to rectify mistakes later. We will always try our utmost to get the restaurant (takeaway outlets) to rectify errors they have made, and will attempt to mediate between the customer and the restaurant, but cannot take responsibility if the restaurant (takeaway outlets) is not willing to rectify their mistakes or issue a refund. The restaurant in question may choose to re-cook the food, or provide the missing items. We can re-deliver these items on the basis that they pay the delivery charge to deliver the items in question to yourself. We may occasionally waive this charge for the restaurant but this is entirely at our discretion. If the restaurant (takeaway outlets) is unwilling to get the item re-delivered, and chooses to provide a refund instead, we will happily pass this back to you either as a credit applied to your registered profile with us, to be used towards future orders, or refund it to you by the same method of original payment once we have received the refund from the restaurant. In the event the mistake has been made by us (i.e. if we have ordered the incorrect item / items), we will either replace the item for you, or credit / refund the amount of the incorrect item. Please note: Any refunds due will be made at the end of our evening shift (after 11am), or at a mutually suitable time as agreed between you and the shift manager on the day.
                        <br/>
                        For complaints regarding quality of food supplied by a restaurant, customers are advised to contact the restaurant (takeaway outlets) concerned direct. We are only a delivery service agent and although we may take up a complaint on behalf of the customer we do not, however, offer compensation or replacements in such events. In case there's a complaint with any of the fast food outlet, please speak to us first and we'll try to resolve this. Fast food outlets are not liable for missing menu or any other related issue with your food.

                        We operate a zero violence tolerance policy, and will not accept any verbal or physical abuse to our staff or drivers. Any such incidents will be reported to the police and will be prosecuted to the maximum extent of the law
                        <br/>
                        We reserve the right not to deliver: - Outside our operating / delivery times - Outside our delivery zone - In dangerous weather / driving conditions - To unregistered addresses and customers - To customers we deem to have been rude to any of our staff, or customers who we deem to be a risk (i.e. non-payers, abusive, etc). - To minors ordering alcohol, cigarettes or any age restricted item(s) - To customers in public establishments, where that establishment is not a registered delivery address, or where we feel our delivery would conflict with, compromise or affect the operations of that establishment - To a registered banned customer or addresses - Any off-license drinks must only be accepted by the person who ordered it and a signature and an ID with a PASS stamp provided on delivery

                        Assaults on our drivers, their vehicles, their belongings or properties will be reported to the authorities and where possible charges will be brought against the offender

                        Collection from the first restaurant incurs a single delivery charge (found in the delivery costs page). Collections from each restaurant thereafter will incur an extra &pound;1.00 delivery charge per restaurant.

                        The prices of items listed on our site(s) are the prices in force on the date and at the time on which we receive / process your order. We make every effort to ensure that the prices on our website are accurate. Nevertheless, as our site(s) contain a large number of Products it is always possible that, despite our best efforts, some of the items on our site(s) may be incorrectly priced. We will normally verify prices as part of our dispatch procedures. However we are under no obligation to provide or deliver to you at an incorrect lower price quoted on our site(s). We will inform you if this is the case, and you can choose to cancel the order at that point.
                        <br/>
                        For concerns regarding nut allergies or any other form of food allergy, we strongly advise customers to contact the restaurant directly for advice and information regarding content and ingredients before placing the order with us.

                        Each restaurant operates at certain hours, and we can only carry out deliveries for a subset of these hours. These times can be determined by communicating with the respective restaurant, and our delivery hours for these restaurants can be seen on the individual restaurant / menu pages on our website. Restaurant holiday hours may vary.
                        <br/>
